    <h2>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming </h2>
    <p>lust like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by informal rules_ Most of these rules
        are formulated over decades Programming Languages often remain in usage for longer Mum their founders expect.
    </p>
    <p>Programmers find um...Ive ways . recreate these languages for different purposes. Th., some static do's and
        don'ts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding_ Normally, a great code has three common features_
        maintainability, dependability, and usability h should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing
        emironments. However, before codum even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled m order to provide a
        solid foundation on a. readable code .n be written.
    </p>

    <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
    <p>This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficlent even Sit is
        completed. The prerequisites Mat need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and
        architecture_ An important question is how developmeent is stmctured. What Is the specific purpose of the
        software? The problem Mat Me code is meaat to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the
        individual components"! Such basic requirements have TO be fulfilled when a good code is being written.</p>
    <p>Hoare makes a good pomt when it comes to assessing software design and architecture. Either a code is so simple
        that there are obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no obvious errors. Software design is
        also of importance to clients, who can decide .their needs are being adequately addressed. If there are some
        IfUngs that architecture cannot take care of, men those are handled in the software design phase. A detailed
        design is a good mule for coding.
    </p>
    <p>The next step is to measure existing programming languages against the requirements to decide on an appropna. one
        If needed a mired m.me can be adopted Once these are met, rt becomes easier to follow- some established good
        coding practices_
    </p>

    <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
    <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often Ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by
        multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge trans.. Name of the module, propose of the
        module, description of the module, original mthor, modifications and authors who modified code with a
        description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice. </p>

    <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
    <p>Using good mowing conventions Is the next step to good cod, ORev developers use 171 or XI as variables, and then
        do not repLace them with meaningful names. To pseymt this confusion and utter waste of time, descriptive names
        should be used
    </p>

    <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
    <p>The key to a good code is also simphcity. To achieve a vermin result, developers may use complex logic but.is
        should be nunimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may use it for a different
        purpose and may not even completely understand or utilise the complex logic. Simple code does not always depend
        on the length att. code. The code must also be conceptually sinmle. Al added advantage is if the code is also
        suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a page and programmer keystrokes can be reduced. </p>

    <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
    <p>Another feature of a good code is porMbiltty. If the code contains values referring to 'absolute parameters such
        as file names, UllLs or In addresses, it will not[ on a host that is of a different design. A good programmer
        will parametrize these variables and configure them so the application can also be run and maintained m a
        different emiromnent. </p>

    <h3>TESTING</h3>
    <p>Testing Is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases must be planned while the code is being
        written, and they are developed while an application is coded. DEBUGGING THE CODE While waiting a code, it is
        necessary to check for errors throughout. Though It Is Ene for smaller progams to be debugged after they have
        been written, this becomes a botdeneck for longer programmes. The best practice, therefore, is to debug each
        module as soon as it has been created. DEPLOYMENT Once the code has been IFTIttell, it has to be deployed. Tlae
        installation Eles should be kept to a mimmum and updated regularly. Unused code or anything that is not
        necessary should not .1..11.. </p>

    <h3>The best practices for coding </h3>
    <p>The best practices for coding are, mast of all, designed to reduce risk whenever Mere are chances of it. For a
        beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled programmer writing numerous
        codes, all these guidelines will come m handy. Since* can[ up to millions of lines . times, outdated advice lake
        'keep it ample. or 'less is more' is priceless and should always be rememb</p>
